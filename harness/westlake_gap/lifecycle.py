"""How far a launch actually got, instead of whether an app lit up.

"Did it render" is the obvious way to score a launch loop and it is the wrong one, in both
directions. On 2026-09-22 a shim fix took NewPipe and AnkiDroid from SIGTRAP with fourteen
symbol-load failures to no signal and zero -- unambiguously correct, traced to a specific
commit-ordering regression -- and neither app rendered. Scored on rendering, a correct fix reads
as a failure. In the other direction Aegis and AntennaPod rendered before any of it and would have
rendered afterwards regardless; scored on rendering they look like evidence and carry none.

What separates those cases is how far the process got before it stopped, which the launch log
already says. The rungs below are the ones that actually discriminated across a ten-app corpus --
each was checked against apps whose outcome was known from a screenshot, not chosen for being
plausible.

A rung plus the identity of the first blocker is the score. The rung says how far; the blocker
says what to fix; neither alone is enough.

#: progress log are not a lifecycle signal. No marker here separates "reached the activity" from
#: "built a view" on its own, so this rung is inferred from the two outcomes that are visible.
